# Coursera_Capstone
## Introduction
In this final project, we are tasked with using the Foursquare API data creatively to come up with a solution for a problem or task of our choosing. The task or business problem that I've come up with is based on tourism.
I've always loved to travel and have been to several different countries. One of my favorite places to visit is Rome for its historic monuments, architecture, and food, of course. However, once the trip was over, I already had the itch to travel again and explore more of the world. One major issue that I and many people who love to travel is, where do we go next? It can be a difficult question to answer with many variables in play, but I believe the best place to start, is to reflect on where you've been and what you loved about those places, in hopes of finding new places to explore that are similar.
## Data
This is where the Foursquare API comes in. Foursquare offers venue data from cities all around the world that I'll use to see which types of venues major cities in Europe have. Specifically, I'm going to use the category of each venue and the number of each venue within a 500m radius of the cities center. In addition, we will be scraping location data of European cities from Wikipedia.

## Coming soon... Web app through Flask
